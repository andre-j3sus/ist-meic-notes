# Machine Learning

> Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.

* **Learn** from data;
* **Improve** performance with **experience**;
* There are multiple types of machine learning:
  * **Supervised learning**;
  * **Unsupervised learning**;
  * **Self-supervised learning**;
  * **Reinforcement learning**;
  * **Active learning**.

Steps of a machine learning:

1. Formulate the problem;
2. Collect and clean the data;
3. Learn a model;
4. Evaluate the model.

## Notation

* **Input**: $x \in X$;
* **Output**: $y \in Y$;

## Types of Learning

* **Supervised learning**: pairs $(x, y)$ are provided at training time;
  * **Classification** - binary or multi-class;
  * **Regression**;
* **Unsupervised learning**: only $x$ is provided at training time;
  * **Clustering**;
  * **Pattern mining**;
  * **Dimensionality reduction**;
* **Self-supervised learning**: $x$ is provided at training time, but it is generated from $y$;
* **Reinforcement learning**: the agent interacts with the environment and receives rewards;
* **Active learning**: the learner can query the teacher to obtain the label of a data point.
