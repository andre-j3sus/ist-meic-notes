# Digital Investigation Process

## Digital investigation models

- Predefined patterns of activities when performing an investigation to generate **admissible evidence**;
- Models encourage a complete, rigorous investigation, ensures proper evidence handling, and reduce the chance of mistakes created by preconceived theories, time pressures, etc

### Kruse & Heiser model

1. **Assessment** - prepare a plan of action, and find potential sources of digital evidence;

   1. Define **scope** and likely **venue**;
   2. Identify the **stakeholders**;
   3. Identify the **likely sources** of evidence;
   4. Identify the **forensic tools** required;
   5. Identify the **personnel** needed;
   6. Collect all needed **legal documentation**;
      - Internal investigations - sponsored by an organization; need a signed **letter of agreement**;
      - Civil investigations - the plaintiff and the defendant are two litigants asking the courts to settle a dispute; need **court order prior to starting**;
      - Criminal investigations - The defendant is the person accused of a crime and the plaintiff is the one making the accusation, which will always be some level of government authority; need **court order prior to starting**;

2. **Acquisition** - prevent changes of in situ digital evidence and collect them;
   1. All issues of **legal** search are followed;
   2. Evidence **integrity** was preserved;
      - Collect **without modify**;
      - Always work on a **copy** (**store the original** and other copies in a safe place);
      - In a **“live acquisition”**, use proper procedures to capture data on-site;
      - **Document** all steps;
   3. Evidence presented to the court is **authentic**;
   4. Evidence collection is as **complete** as possible;
   5. Maintain a **chain of custody** (no gaps allowed in history, no inconsistent dates, needs signatures, and custodians need to be competent and authorized);
   6. Generate **integrity checks** to show that the evidence has not been altered from the time it was collected (**message digest algorithm** - hash function (MD5 and SHA-1 no longer secure));
3. **Analysis** - search for an interpret evidence trace in order to reconstruct the crime scene;
   1. Locate and **extract all material evidence** both **inculpatory** and **exculpatory**;
   2. Use court **recognized forensic tools** and document everything;
   3. Examine existing artifacts looking for **evidence**:
      - **Overt evidence** - look through your data image for overt evidence;
      - **Hidden evidence** - look for evidence that the system may have hidden;
      - **Deleted evidence** - look for evidence that the user may have deleted, but it's still recoverable;
      - Look for evidence of **anti-forensic** techniques;
4. **Reporting** - reporting of findings in a manner which satisfies the context of the investigation;
   - **General case documentation** - contact info for everyone involved, all legal authorizations, notes, photographs, videos, etc;
   - **Procedural documentation** - every performed task;
   - **Process documentation** - User manuals, installation manuals, update history logs, results of testing;
   - **Case timeline**.

- Other models were proposed, but are complex, rigid or incomplete.
- Digital investigators need to complement investigation models with the **scientific method**.
