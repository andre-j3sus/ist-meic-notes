# Legal Framework

## Digital evidence and law

- Courts decide whether the law was broken;
  - **Judicial courts**: ordinary courts in the civil sphere; deal with civil and criminal issues, with jurisdiction in all matters not allocated to other judicial bodies
  - Supreme Court > Courts of appeal > District courts
- **Crime** is an offensive act against society that violates a law and is punishable by the state;
  - Must violate at least one **current** criminal law;
  - It is the state (not the victim) that punished the violator;
- Criminal laws are defined in rules called **criminal statuses**;
- The **prosecutor** tries to persuade the judge and/or jury that the **defendant** did the acts;

### Cybercrime

- Aka computer crime, information crime, high-tech crime;
- _Any illegal act involving a computer, its systems, or its applications_;
- Examples:
  - Theft of intellectual property;
  - Identity theft/fraud;
  - Financial fraud;
  - Cyberbullying/cyberstalking;
  - Child pornography;
  - ...
- Computers can be involved in two ways:
  - Computer as **targets**;
  - Computer as **tools**;
- **Digital crime scene**: The electronic environment where digital evidence can potentially exist;

> **Locard’s Exchange Principle**: in the commission of a crime, the perpetrator **leaves something** at the crime scene, and **takes away with him something** from the crime scene. These “somethings” are **evidence**
>
> E.g.: a user logs in amazon.com; it leaves an entry in the server log; it takes with it a cookie or a cache entry in the browser.
>
> **Other examples**: login attempts, commands executed, recently accessed files, visited networks, ...

## Admissibility of digital evidence

- Only **admissible** evidence be accepted in court;
- Judges use guidelines for admissibility:
  - Is the evidence **relevant**?
    - It must be **material** – **directly relating to the case** being presented;
    - It must be **probative** – **proves something** that will help get to the truth of the situation;
  - Is the evidence **authentic**?
    - Evidence was **acquired from a specific computer and/or location**;
    - A **complete and accurate copy** of the evidence was acquired;
    - Evidence **remained unchanged** since it was collected;
  - Is the evidence **credible**?
    - Is the material an opinion (**hearsay**)?
      - Knowledge from secondary sources is usually inadmissible;
    - Exceptions to the hearsay rule:
      - Business records;
      - When a person is not involved, namely computer-generated data;
  - Was the evidence **collected legally**?
    - **Search warrants** are required.
