# Anomaly Detection

> **Anomaly Detection** is the identification of records that do not conform to expected (normal) behaviour.

* **Outliers** are values that deviate from the expected behavior - **variable perspective**;
* **Anomalies** are records that deviate from the expected behavior - **record perspective**;
* **Point anomalies** are individual records that are anomalous;
* **Contextual anomalies** are records that are anomalous in a specific context - record at the same distance of both clusters, but does not belong to any of them;
* **Collective anomalies** are records that are anomalous when considered together - a record that is not anomalous by itself, but is anomalous when considered with other records.

## Anomaly Detection Techniques

* **Classification-based** - **train a classifier** to distinguish between normal and anomalous records - **supervised**;
* **Clustering-based** - **cluster** the records and consider the records in small clusters as anomalies - **unsupervised**;
* **Statistical-based** - **model** the normal records and consider the records that do not fit the model as anomalies - **unsupervised**;
* **Proximity-based** - **measure the distance** between records and consider the records that are far away from the others as anomalies - **unsupervised**.

## Assessment

* **Recal**, also known as **True Positive Rate** or **Sensitivity**, is the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such: $recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$;
* ROC charts are the best way to compare classifiers.
