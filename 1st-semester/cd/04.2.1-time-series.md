# Time Series

> **Time Series** is a sequence of real values measuring some variable **over time**, usually at **uniform intervals**.
>
> In **Multivariate Time Series** the goal is to study **multiple variables** that change over time.

## Time Series Profiling

* **Dimensionality** - number of elements in the sequence;
* **Granularity** - time interval between each element; 
* **Components** - time series can be decomposed in its components:
  * **Trend** - general variation over time;
  * **Seasonal** - periodic variation over time - >= 1 year;
  * **Cyclical** - periodic variation over time - < 1 year;
  * **Residual/Noise** - irregularities and fluctuation that occur along time, are random, have a short length and are non-repetitive;
* **Stationarity** - a time series is stationary if its statistical properties (mean, variance, covariance) do not change over time;
  * There is **no trend or seasonality**;
  * The easiest way to check for stationarity is to plot the data and check for trends or seasonality;
  * The **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test** is a statistical test for stationarity;
    * **$p-value \leq 0.05$** - the time series is **stationary**;
    * **$p-value > 0.05$** - the time series is **not stationary**;

### Distance Measures between Time Series

* We need to compare the values observed in every instant of time, which can be done by viewing each series as a point in $R^n$, where $n$ is the number of observations;
  * Then, we can use the **Euclidean distance** to compare the series;

Some of these **time distortions** are particularly relevant:

* **Vertical Offset Translation** - series present similar behavior, but with different vertical offsets;
* **Horizontal Offset Translation**- series present similar behavior, but with different time lags;
* **Amplitude Scaling** - series present similar behavior, but with different amplitudes;
* **Linear Trend** - series present similar behavior, but with different linear trends;
* **Noise** - series present similar behavior, but with different noise levels.

#### Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)

* Distance measure that allows for **time distortions**;
* Recursively computes the **optimal alignment** between two time series;
* Uses Euclidean distance as a local distance measure;
* $DTW_{\text{distance}} = \frac{1}{N} min(\sqrt{\sum_{n=1}^N (x_i - y_i)^2})$;
* Construct a matrix $M$ of size $N \times M$, where $N$ and $M$ are the number of points in the two time series;
  * $M_{i,j} = (x_i - y_j)^2 + min(M_{i-1, j}, M_{i, j-1}, M_{i-1, j-1})$;
  * $DTW_{\text{distance}} = M_{N, M}$.

## Time Series Transformation

* **Sliding Window** - start at the beginning of the time series, apply a function to the first $k$ points, then move the window one step forward and repeat the process, until there are no more points in the time series;

* **Moving Average** - average of the values in the window;
  * Used to **smooth** the time series;
  * Applying **average in sliding window approach**;
  * **Exponential Moving Average** - weighted average of the values in the window, where the weights decrease exponentially as we move back in time;

* **Normalization** - addresses the **amplitude scaling problem**; the goal is to scale the values of the time series to a fixed range, usually $[0, 1]$ or $[-1, 1]$;

* **Trend Removal** - Compute the straight line that best fits the original time series and then subtract the former from the latter (the result is a time series with no trend);

* **Differencing** - Compute the difference between consecutive values of the time series (the result is a time series with no trend and no seasonality);

* **Segmentation** - Split the time series into segments and then apply a function to each segment;
  * **Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA)** - split the time series into $k$ segments and then compute the average of each segment; **fast, simple and intuitive**;
  * **Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX)** - split the time series into $k$ segments and then map each segment to a symbol, based on the average of the segment; **linear time to compute**; fewer bits to encode symbols;
  * **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** - represent a time series as a **linear composition of eigen waves**;
  * **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** - represent a time series as a **linear composition of sine and cosine waves**;
  * **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)** - represent a time series as a **linear composition of wavelets** - functions that cut the sequence into different frequency components.
