# ist-meic-notes 🗒️

> This repository contains notes from my journey through the [MSc in Computer Science and Computer Engineering (Mestrado em Engenharia Informática e de Computadores - MEIC)](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/education/courses/masters-programmes/computer-science-and-engineering/) at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), from 2023 to 2025.

> If you're interested in my earlier academic journey, you can also check out my notes from the [BSc in Computer Science and Computer Engineering (Licenciatura em Engenharia Informática e de Computadores - LEIC)](https://www.isel.pt/en/curso/bsc-degree/computer-science-and-computer-engineering) at [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/en), which I documented in the [isel-leic-notes](https://github.com/andre-j3sus/isel-leic-notes) repository.

I started taking notes to study for different courses and later decided to share them to help my classmates and future students in their studies. Here, I present the notes I took during my time at IST, hoping that they can be helpful to others, whether they are students or simply curious individuals interested in studying these topics.

Please note that the notes may not have the same formatting, and some of them may even be incomplete. While some subjects have well-organized and written Markdown notes, others may have PDFs of handwritten notes or other useful attached resources.

**Feel free to contribute to improving these notes. Happy studying!**

## Repository Overview

- The **sole purpose** of these notes is to share the knowledge and notes that I have acquired throughout the course.
- Some notes are written in Portuguese, and others in English. However, a future goal is to have a version available in both languages.
- The notes are intended as a **summary** of the subjects and are not meant to be a substitute for official course materials.
- I am not responsible for any errors or omissions in the notes.
- If you find any errors or omissions, please open an issue or a pull request to bring them to my attention.
- Contributions are welcome. If you want to contribute, please open an issue or a pull request.
