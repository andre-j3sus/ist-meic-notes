# [Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance Consensus Algorithm](<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03613.pdf#:~:text=The%20algorithm%20is%20deterministic%2C%20leader,(n2)%20total%20communication%20complexity.>)

- Assumes a **partially synchronous** communication model - there is a known upper bound on message delivery time, and the system is synchronous after that bound;
  - **Safety** does not depend on synchrony assumptions;
  - **Liveness** does depend on synchrony assumptions;
- **Deterministic** - the algorithm is deterministic, the leader is chosen deterministically, and the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate;
- **Leader-based** - the algorithm is leader-based, with the leader being chosen deterministically;
- **Optimally Resilient** - tolerates up to $f$ Byzantine nodes in a network of $n \geq 3f + 1$ nodes;
- During normal operation, IBFT achieves termination in **three communication rounds** and has a **total communication complexity of $O(n^2)$**;
- **Quorum-based** - the algorithm is quorum-based, with a quorum size of $⌊\frac{n + f}{2}⌋ + 1$.

### Guarantees

- **Agreement** - if a correct process decides some value $v$, then no correct process decides a value $v'$ such that $v \neq v'$;
- **Validity** - given an externally provided predicate $\beta$, if a correct process decides a value $v'$, then $\beta(v')$ is true;
  - The predicate $\beta$ is provided by the application and is used to determine the validity of the decision, in the context of the application - e.g., in a blockchain, $\beta$ could be the validity of a block;
- **Termination** - all correct processes eventually decide a value.

## Protocol Overview

### Normal Case Operation

#### Start Consensus

- Each process calls the `startConsensus` function, which initializes the consensus state, receiving a value $v$ to propose;
- Each process $p_i$ contains:
  - $\lambda_{i}$ - the consensus instance number;
  - $r_{i}$ - the round number of the consensus instance;
  - $pr_{i}$ - the round at which the process has prepared a value; initially $pr_{i} = \bot$;
  - $pv_{i}$ - the value that the process has prepared; initially $pv_{i} = \bot$;
  - $inputValue_{i}$ - the value that the process received as input to the consensus instance, and will propose if it is the leader;
- **If the process is the leader**, it broadcasts `PRE-PREPARE` messages to all other processes, containing the value $v$;
- Each process **starts a timer**.

#### Pre-Prepare Phase

- Upon receiving a valid `PRE-PREPARE` message from the leader, and its **justified**:
  - Resets its timer;
  - Broadcasts a `PREPARE` message to all other processes.

#### Prepare Phase

- Upon receiving a quorum ($⌊\frac{n + f}{2}⌋ + 1$) of valid `PREPARE` messages:
  - Update $pr_{i}$ and $pv_{i}$;
  - Broadcasts a `COMMIT` message to all other processes.

#### Commit Phase

- Upon receiving a quorum ($⌊\frac{n + f}{2}⌋ + 1$) of valid `COMMIT` messages:
  - Stops the timer;
  - Decides the value $v$ with quorum $Q_{commit}$.

### Round Changes (View Changes)

#### Timer Expiration

- If the timer expires:
  - The process increments the round number $r_{i}$;
  - Resets the timer;
  - Broadcasts a `ROUND-CHANGE` message to all other processes.

#### Round-Change Phase

- Upon receiving $f + 1$ valid `ROUND-CHANGE` messages:

  - Updates the round number $r_{i}$;
  - Resets the timer;
  - Broadcasts a `ROUND-CHANGE` message to all other processes.

- Upon receiving a quorum ($⌊\frac{n + f}{2}⌋ + 1$) of valid `ROUND-CHANGE` messages, and the process is the leader:

  - Get the highest prepared value $pv_{max}$, if any;
  - Broadcasts a `PRE-PREPARE` message to all other processes, starting a new round.

- Upon receiving a valid `ROUND-CHANGE` message for an instance already decided:
  - Broadcasts the $Q_{commit}$ to the process, so that it can decide the value.

### Justifications

- A `ROUND-CHANGE` message is **justified** if:

  - There is no $pr_{i}$ and $pv_{i}$, meaning that the leader of the round has not prepared a value, or;
  - Received a quorum of `PREPARE` messages for the value $pv_{i}$ and round $pr_{i}$.

- A `PRE_PREPARE` message is **justified** if:
  - The **round number is 1**, or;
  - Received a quorum of `ROUND_CHANGE` messages for that round, and each of them is **justified**.

> **Note:** For messages who need to be justified, the **justification** is piggybacked on the message itself.
