# Bitcoin

> **Bitcoin** is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

## Proof-of-Work (PoW)

- Proof-of-Work is a process that requires **some work to be done** before a block can be added to the blockchain;
- The work is **computationally intensive** and **time-consuming**;
- The work is **easy to verify**;
- This limits the rate at which blocks can be added to the blockchain, and thus the rate at which new coins can be created;
- In bitcoin, **miners** compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle, they aggregate transactions in blocks, allowing for better throughput;
  - They compete to get block appended to the blockchain, and they are rewarded with new coins.

### PoW in Bitcoin

- Each miner has a **transaction pool** - set of transactions received over the network or created by the miner;
- Miners try to create a valid block by solving a puzzle: `SHA256(h || T || K || nonce) < D`, where:
  - `h` is the hash of the previous block;
  - `T` is the set of transactions;
  - `K` is the public key of the miner;
  - `nonce` is a random number;
  - `D` is the difficulty level.
- When solved, broadcast new block to all miners;
- A **block** includes:
  - A subset of transactions from the pool, chosen by the miner;
  - A pointer to the previous block;
  - The identity of the miner;
  - The solution to the puzzle.

### Block Dissemination

- Every node keeps a copy of every block of transactions;
  - Can be a **scalability bottleneck**;
- Upon receiving a new block, miners validate the block and its transactions;
  - If valid, they **add the block to their local copy of the blockchain** and broadcast it to all other miners and **start mining the next block**.

> ### Clients, Miners and Nodes
>
> - **Clients** - users that create transactions and broadcast them to the miners;
> - **Miners** - nodes that create new blocks solving the PoW puzzle;
> - **Full nodes** - nodes that keep a full copy of the blockchain;
> - **Compact/light nodes** - nodes that keep only the block headers.

### Properties

- **Prevents sybil attacks** - solving the puzzle requires computational power;
- **Tamper-proof** - pointer to the previous block;
  - Changing a block would require changing all subsequent blocks;
  - Rewriting the blockchain is computationally infeasible.
- Provides **incentives** for miners to behave honestly;
  - Miners are rewarded with new coins;
  - Miners are also rewarded with transaction fees;
- Generating a block can be seen as a random **Poisson process**;
  - The time between blocks is exponentially distributed.

### Forks

- **Fork** - when two miners solve the puzzle at the same time;
  - The blockchain is **forked** into two chains;
  - Miners will try to mine in parallel chains;
- **Longest chain rule** - miners will mine on the longest chain;
  - The longest chain is the one with the most accumulated work;
  - The other chain will be discarded.
- **Problem: lack of finality** - a transaction is considered confirmed after a few blocks, but not immediately - **probabilistic finality**.

## Attacks

### Double Spending

Spending the same coin twice:

1. Attacker sends a transaction to a merchant, and also sends the same coin to another merchant;
2. The attacker tries to mine a block that includes the first transaction, and broadcasts it to the network;
3. The attacker tries to mine another block that includes the second transaction, and broadcasts it to the network;
4. The network will accept the first block, and the second block will be discarded.

### Rental Attack (51% Attack)

- An attacker controls **more than 50%** of the network's computational power;
- Overly expensive for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but not for smaller blockchains.

### Finney Attack

- Attacker successfully pre-mines a block including a transaction that sends some of his coins back to himself, without broadcasting it;
- Attacker then makes a purchase from a merchant, and waits for the merchant to deliver the goods;
- After the goods are delivered, the attacker broadcasts the pre-mined block, overwriting the transaction that paid the merchant.

## Mining Pools

- **Mining pool** - a group of miners that work together to mine blocks;
  - They share the reward;
  - They share the computational power;
  - They share the risk of not being able to solve the puzzle;
  - They share the risk of being attacked;
- As mining becomes more difficult, mining pools become more common;
- CPU mining -> GPU mining -> ASIC mining.

### Feather-forking Attack

- Suppose that a mining pool controls 40% of the network's computational power, and wants to censor Alice;
- Mining pool announces it will refuse to mine any block that includes a transaction from Alice;
- Creates a disincentive for every miner to include Alice's transactions in their blocks.

### Selfish Mining

- A mining pool keeps its blocks private - they create their own **private fork**;
- When public chain catches up (the public chain is the longest), the pool releases its private chain, and the public chain is discarded.

## PoW blockchains vs Consensus

| **Property**    | **Consensus**                                      | **PoW**                                         |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Termination** | ✅Correct nodes eventually agree on the same value | ✅Blocks are added at a fixed rate              |
| **Integrity**   | ✅No correct process decides twice                 | ❌Forks                                         |
| **Agreement**   | ✅All correct processes decide the same value      | ❌Forks                                         |
| **Validity**    | ✅Decided value has been proposed by some process  | ❌Byzantine processes can generate transactions |

- Classical consensus emphasizes **safety** (integrity and agreement);
- PoW emphasizes **liveness** (termination and agreement) - the system always makes progress.

> **Safety vs Liveness tradeoff**

## Bitcoin Data Structures

Each block in the blockchain is a set of transactions:

- Transactions can have **multiple inputs** and **<= 2 outputs**;
- It is possible to specify a set of deterministic operations, with conditions on transfer (smart contracts);
- Each **input** describes **debit** -> sender signs handoff of amount (signed with private key);
- Each **output** describes **credit** -> receiver's address and amount.

### UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) Model

- Blockchains stores all transaction since the beginning of time;
- Additionally, keeps track of outputs that haven't been spent yet, called **unspent transaction outputs** (UTXOs);
- When a transaction is created, it consumes UTXOs and creates new ones.

---

## Bitcoin Scalability and UtreeXO

- Resources required for running a full node are a problem, as the blockchain grows;
- Continuously maintaining a set of UTXOs is expensive;
- **Light clients** - do not keep state nor validate transactions, but rely on full nodes;
  - Led to the proposal of **UtreeXO** - a way to compress the UTXO set;
  - A new set of data structures that allow for efficient UTXO set compression;
  - Store **only a summary** of the UTXO set, and not the entire set.
