# Solidity

> **Solidity** is a statically typed, contract programming language that has similarities to JavaScript and C. It is designed for writing **smart contracts** that run on the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**.

### Smart Contracts

- **Smart contracts** are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code;
- **Flexible**;
- **Transparent** -> trusted;
- **DeFi** - decentralized finance.

### Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.2;
contract Coin {
    address public minter;
    mapping (address => uint) public balances;

    constructor() public {
        minter = msg.sender;
    }

    function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == minter);
        require(amount < 1e60);
        balances[receiver] += amount;
    }
}
```

- `pragma` - version of the Solidity compiler this code should use;
  - `^` - compatible with the specified version and all future versions;
- `contract` - keyword to declare a new contract - like a class;
- `address` - type of Ethereum addresses;
- `mapping` - a key-value store for storing and looking up data;
- `constructor` - function that runs once when the contract is created;
