# Mobile UI Design

## Challenges of Mobile UI Design

**\* One hand usage**;

- **Context constraints**:
  - Noise;
  - Attention;
  - Situation type;
  - **Brief interactions**;

## Interaction Design

- **Touch**;
- **Gestures**;
- **Voice**;
- No cursor;
- No hover;
- Fat fingers;
- Spacing;
- Lack of **haptic feedback** (haptic means touch).

Design principles:

1. **Learnability** - easy boarding experience;
2. **Visibility** - user should know what to do;
3. **Memorability** - user should remember how to use the app;
4. **Efficiency** - user should be able to perform tasks quickly;
5. **Mapping** - user should be able to understand the relationship between the controls and the actions;
6. **User control** - user should control, and not the system;
7. **Consistency** - user should be able to predict the system's behavior;
8. **Simplicity** - user should not be overwhelmed by the syste;
9. **Error prevention and recovery** - user should not make mistakes, but if they do, they should be able to recover;
10. **Satisfaction** - user should be happy with the system.

## Screen Design

- **Miniaturization** is not the solution;
- Mobile forces **simplicity**;
- **Full screen** layouts;
- Divide tasks into screens;
